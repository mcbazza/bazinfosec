# bazinfosec
For infosec stuff that I pick up along the way

## Scripts

[pastebin.sh](https://github.com/mcbazza/bazinfosec/blob/master/scripts/pastebin.sh) - this writes stdin as a private paste to your pastebin.com account

[pastebin-get.sh](https://github.com/mcbazza/bazinfosec/blob/master/scripts/pastebin-get.sh) - this pulls down a paste from your pastebin.com account to stdout

## Tools

[mssql_shell.py](https://github.com/mcbazza/bazinfosec/blob/master/mssql_shell.py) - this is for connecting to MSSQL and getting a shell, tweaked to support SQL2K on Win2K
